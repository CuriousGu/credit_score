Logistic Regression to measure the credit risk

There is no big difference between the dumb model and the final version. Furthermore, the dataset seems to have been 'adjusted' for model training, 
the categorical variables do not appear to have impact on the results.

So, I focused on increasing the recall for class 0 because it's more important not to grant credit to those who won't pay."
